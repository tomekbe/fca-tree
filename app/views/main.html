					<p> This tool is designed to help you decide whether you need to apply for limited or full permission. However it is not a definitive statement of the law, for which you should refer to paragraph 2G of Schedule 6 to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. For more
	guidance see the relevant sections of the FCA Handbook (in particular COND 1.1A.5A) and
	consider seeking independent legal or compliance advice.</p>

					<li>This decision tree applies if you intend on carrying on credit-related activities only and no other non-credit regulated activities (unless you carry these on as an appointed representative). If you intend to carry on any other regulated activity and you are not currently authorised, you should apply in the normal way for authorisation to carry out the non-credit activities and complete the consumer credit supplement form. If you are already authorised by the FCA or PRA for other regulated activities, you should apply for a variation of permission.</li>
					<li>If any of your answers are full permission you will need to apply for full permission, even if some of your activities would otherwise qualify for limited permission
